<h1> <i> <u> The Evolution of Computers. </i> </u> </h1>
<h2> <u> The First Computer. </u> </h2>

<br/>

<p>   The first mechanical computer was created in 1822 by <i>Charles Babbage</i>. He called it The Babbage Difference Engine. </b>
<p> The ABC <b>(Atanasoff Berry Computer)</b> was the basis for the modern computer we all use today. The ABC weighed over 700 pounds and used vacuum tubes. </p>

<p> It had a rotating drum, a little bigger than a paint can, that had small capacitors on it. </p>

<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
<p> The capacitor is a device that could store an electric charge like a battery.</p>

<p> The ABC was designed to solve problems with equations upto <b> 29 </b> different variables.</p>
<p> These are common problems in physics and other sciences which are difficult to solve by hand. </p>
<br/>
<p> The ABC completed an operation about every 15 seconds, which is a lot slower than the computers we use which completes millions </p>
of operations per second.</p>
<p> Unlike modern day computers we have today, the ABC had no change-able stored program. This meant the program was only designed to </p>
do a single task. It also meant for these to be solved, an operator had to write down the answer and then feed it back </p>
to the ABC.</p>

<br/>
<p> The computers back then were more complex and harder to use whenever you wanted to. Nowadays most computers can be used as a carry on and they </p>
<p> are easier to understand how to use them.</p>
<p> Present day computers are easier to get than back then since it was very hard and expensive to get your hands on a computer unlike today. </p>
