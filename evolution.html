<br/> 
<p> As you can see from the picture above the evoloution of computers came along way and it is still on going. </p>
<p> The first computer was created in 1822. The big box like computer was a really large hit to the evolution of computers. </p>
<p> A little bit later around in the late 60s to 70s, rectangular computers were created. The tiny screen could only show so little information on it. </p> 
<p> The box like computers slowly came less popular after a few decades.</p>
<br/>
<p> A  little bit later down the years, flat pannel computers were created.</p>
<p> These computers were much flatter and lighter, but there was no big change than the wide pannel ones.</p>

<p> To this day people still use the big box like computers but, it is very hard to find someone who uses those types of computers. </p>
<br/>
<p> The most common computers that are being used to this day are laptops.</p>

<p> Laptops are the most commonly used type of computer. </p>
<p> With its flat foldable shape; like a flip phone, these computers are being used world wide.
<p> Since it folds, people can easily carry it around like a carry on.</p>
